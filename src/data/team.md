# Introduction

We are a team of 5 members. All of us are studying Computer Engineering and will be graduating in Spring 2022. We come from diverse backgrounds and have done many internships at different companies. We all like to play games and have an interest in AI so we decided to do a project involving Reinforcement Learning and Games. One interesting fact is that most of the team members were not in Computer Engineering to begin with. Matthew was originally studying Chemical Engineering, Ken was orignally studying Enviroment Engineering, Micheal was orignally studying Mechanical Engineering, and Ethan was originally studying Biomedical Engineering. 

# Team Roles

Because we have different backgrounds that means that we have different strengths and weakness. We all have a role in the team and they are:
- Matthew Tang (Project Manager, General SWE)
- Ken Ming Lee (Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning)
- Ethan Lee (Reinforcement Learning, General SWE)
- Michael Meng (Data Storage, ETL Pipelines)
- Cliff Li (Game Design and Development)

# Consultant

The consultant for the project was [Mark Crowley](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/profile/mcrowley). He is an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. His research and focus is on developing new algorithms within the fields of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning and Ensemble Methods. He often works in collaboration with researchers in applied fields such as sustainable forest management, ecology, autonomous driving, physical chemistry and medical imaging.
